                    It's our first step towards finding your style and building
                    your perfect wardrobe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, I ask you to fill in a small questionnaire. It helps
                    me to understand your life. After all, every person is
                    unique. And you. You're very special, I'm telling you for
                    sure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Armed with your questionnaire and my knowledge, and
                    experience accumulated over the years, I'll help you find
                    your style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the meeting, I evaluate what you already have in your
                    wardrobe. We analyze your body type together. And when you
                    go to the store next time, you'll have no hesitation over
                    cuts and styles you should pay attention to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I show you how to style what you already have in your
                    wardrobe, create new outfits with all your clothes, and
                    update them to look brand new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I prepare a list of what can be added to your wardrobe
                    during your next shopping. Our shopping list will consist
                    entirely of things that match everything in your wardrobe.
